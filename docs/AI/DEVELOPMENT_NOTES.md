# Game Development Analysis

## Original Game Analysis (Godot)

The original HCMUS-Game is a classic endless runner game similar to Chrome's T-Rex game. Here's the complete analysis:

### Core Game Mechanics

1. **Player Character (Dino)**
   - Can jump (SPACE/UP key)
   - Can duck (DOWN key) 
   - Has collision detection
   - Animated states: idle, run, jump, duck

2. **Obstacle System**
   - Ground obstacles: stump, rock, barrel
   - Flying obstacles: bird (at two different heights)
   - Procedural generation based on score/difficulty
   - Multiple obstacles can spawn in groups

3. **Scrolling System**
   - Fixed camera following player
   - Infinite ground scrolling
   - Parallax background layers

4. **Game Logic**
   - Speed increases with score
   - Difficulty progression (more obstacles)
   - Score tracking and high score persistence
   - Game over on collision

### Key Constants from Original Code
- `DINO_START_POS`: (150, 485)
- `GRAVITY`: 4200
- `JUMP_SPEED`: -1800
- `START_SPEED`: 10.0
- `MAX_SPEED`: 25
- `SPEED_MODIFIER`: 5000
- `SCORE_MODIFIER`: 10
- `MAX_DIFFICULTY`: 2
- `BIRD_HEIGHTS`: [200, 390]

## Python Implementation

### Architecture Design

The Python version follows the same structure as the original but uses object-oriented principles:

1. **GameObject Base Class**: Common functionality for all game entities
2. **MainGame Class**: Core game loop and state management
3. **Specialized Classes**: Dino, Obstacles, Background, HUD, GameOver
4. **Manager Classes**: ObstacleManager for handling multiple obstacles

### Key Differences from Original

1. **Physics**: Adapted from Godot's built-in physics to custom implementation
2. **Coordinates**: Godot uses different coordinate system than Pygame
3. **Animation**: Simplified animation system (extensible for sprite sheets)
4. **Audio**: Pygame mixer instead of Godot's audio system
5. **Input**: Pygame event system instead of Godot's input actions

### Implementation Features

âœ… **Completed Features (Current Repository)**:

- Endless running gameplay & progressive difficulty
- Obstacle set: stump, rock, barrel, bird
- Token (coin) spawning & collection tracking (separate `token_score`)
- Powerups (timed): `halfspeed`, `doublegold`, `godmode`
   - Movement slowdown decoupled from score progression via `base_speed` vs `speed`
   - Invincibility allows passage through obstacles without collision
- Parallax scrolling background (multi-layer)
- Jump mechanic (duck placeholder pending art)
- Persistent high score (`high_score.json`)
- HUD: score, high score, coins, active powerups with countdown
- Game over screen & restart flow
- Basic audio (jump sound)

ðŸ”„ **Planned / Potential Enhancements**:

- Additional powerups (shield, score multiplier, jump enhancement)
- Duck state sprite & hitbox adjustments
- Particle / dust effects on land & collision
- Expanded obstacle library + pattern groups
- Animated sprite sheets (current dino placeholder single frame sequences)
- Biome / themed backgrounds (forest, arctic, volcano, space)
- Shop system (skins, cosmetics, map themes)
- Achievements & session analytics

### Performance Considerations

- Uses Pygame's hardware acceleration when available
- Efficient collision detection using pygame.Rect
- Memory management through proper object cleanup
- 60 FPS target with delta time calculations

### Platform Compatibility

- **Windows**: Full support with .bat files for easy setup
- **macOS/Linux**: Full support with shell scripts
- **Python 3.6+**: Required for modern Python features
- **Pygame 2.0+**: Latest version for best performance
