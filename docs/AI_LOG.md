# AI Collaboration Log

This document tracks the AI collaboration process used throughout the development of the T-Rex Runner game project.

## Project Overview

**Project**: Console-based T-Rex Runner Game
**Language**: C++
**Focus**: Object-Oriented Programming principles and Design Patterns
**Date**: July 24, 2025

## AI Collaboration Sessions

### Session 1: Project Planning and Architecture Design

**Prompt**: "I am developing a console-based version of Chrome's T-Rex Runner game for my Object-Oriented Programming final project. The project must heavily utilize OOP principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction) and thoughtfully implement at least three suitable software design patterns."

**AI Response Analysis**:
- AI suggested excellent OOP class hierarchy with abstract base classes
- Recommended three appropriate design patterns with clear justifications
- Provided comprehensive project structure and cross-platform considerations

**Key Decisions Made**:
1. **Singleton Pattern** for GameEngine - ensures single game instance
2. **Factory Pattern** for ObstacleFactory - flexible obstacle creation
3. **Observer Pattern** for event system - decoupled score/event handling

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Start with abstract base classes to define interfaces
- Implement concrete classes with proper inheritance relationships
- Apply design patterns to solve specific architectural problems

### Session 2: Class Design and OOP Implementation

**Prompt**: "Design the core class hierarchy focusing on strong OOP principles"

**AI Analysis**:
- **Encapsulation**: Private data members with controlled public interfaces
- **Inheritance**: Clear base-derived relationships (GameObject → Player, Obstacle)
- **Polymorphism**: Virtual methods for runtime behavior selection
- **Abstraction**: Abstract base classes hide implementation complexity

**Design Decisions**:
```cpp
GameObject (Abstract Base)
├── Player (Concrete)
└── Obstacle (Abstract)
    ├── Cactus (Concrete)
    └── Bird (Concrete)
```

**Benefits Achieved**:
- Consistent interface across all game objects
- Easy extension for new obstacle types
- Polymorphic obstacle behavior
- Clean separation of concerns

### Session 3: Design Pattern Implementation

**Design Pattern Analysis**:

#### Singleton Pattern - GameEngine
**Problem Solved**: Need for single, globally accessible game instance
**Implementation**: Private constructor, static instance management
**Benefits**: 
- Controlled game state
- Prevention of multiple game loops
- Global access point

#### Factory Pattern - ObstacleFactory
**Problem Solved**: Creating different obstacle types with varying parameters
**Implementation**: Static factory methods with type enumeration
**Benefits**:
- Encapsulated creation logic
- Easy addition of new obstacle types
- Configurable creation parameters

#### Observer Pattern - Event System
**Problem Solved**: Decoupling game events from UI and scoring systems
**Implementation**: Observer interface with concrete implementations
**Benefits**:
- Loose coupling between components
- Easy addition of new event handlers
- Separation of concerns

### Session 4: Cross-Platform Input Handling

**Challenge**: Real-time keyboard input without blocking game loop
**AI Suggestions**:
- Platform-specific implementations (Windows vs Unix)
- Non-blocking input detection
- Raw mode terminal settings

**Implementation Strategy**:
```cpp
#ifdef _WIN32
    // Windows: conio.h, _kbhit(), _getch()
#else
    // Unix: termios.h, select(), non-blocking read
#endif
```

### Session 5: Game Loop and Performance Optimization

**Requirements**: Smooth gameplay with consistent frame rate
**AI Recommendations**:
- Fixed timestep game loop
- Frame rate limiting with sleep
- Efficient screen clearing to reduce flicker

**Performance Considerations**:
- Use smart pointers for automatic memory management
- Efficient collision detection algorithms
- Minimal console output for better performance

### Session 6: Build System and Cross-Platform Compatibility

**Challenge**: Supporting Windows, macOS, and Linux builds
**AI Solution**: Comprehensive Makefile with OS detection
**Features Implemented**:
- Automatic OS detection
- Platform-specific compiler flags
- Standard library dependencies only
- Easy build commands (make, make run, make debug)
