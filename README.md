# HCMUS Dinosaur Runner Game

A 2D endless runner game featuring a dinosaur character navigating through procedurally generated obstacles. Built with Godot Engine as part of HCMUS OOP Final Project.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Endless Runner Gameplay**: Classic side-scrolling runner mechanics
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Procedurally generated stumps, rocks, barrels, and flying birds
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Progressive challenge scaling based on player performance
- **Responsive Controls**: Jump and duck mechanics for obstacle avoidance
- **Score System**: Distance-based scoring with high score tracking
- **Parallax Backgrounds**: Multi-layer scrolling backgrounds for depth

## 🕹️ Controls

- **SPACE**: Jump / Start Game
- **DOWN ARROW**: Duck (slide under obstacles)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
