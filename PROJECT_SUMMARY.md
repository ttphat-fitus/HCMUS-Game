# T-Rex Runner Game - Project Summary 🦕

## ✅ Project Cleanup Complete!

### 🧹 What Was Removed:
- **C++ Artifacts**: Removed unnecessary `src/`, `include/`, `bin/`, `obj/` directories and `Makefile`
- **Complex UI System**: Removed `game/ui/` package that was causing infinite menu loops
- **Cache Files**: Cleaned up all Python `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files
- **System Files**: Removed `.DS_Store` files

### 🎮 What Was Fixed:
- **Restored Interactive Gameplay**: Fixed the broken "Start Game" functionality
- **Simplified Main Entry**: Created a working `main.py` that connects to actual T-Rex gameplay
- **Working Game Loop**: Player can now jump, duck, and play the actual T-Rex running game
- **Proper Controls**: SPACE/UP to jump, DOWN/S to duck, P to pause, ESC/Q to quit

### 🎯 Object-Oriented Programming Features:
- **✅ Encapsulation**: Private attributes with controlled access
- **✅ Inheritance**: GameObject base class with Player/Obstacle children
- **✅ Polymorphism**: Different obstacle types with shared interface
- **✅ Abstraction**: Clean interfaces hiding implementation complexity

### 🏗️ Design Patterns Implemented:
- **✅ Singleton Pattern**: GameEngine (single game instance)
- **✅ Factory Pattern**: ObstacleFactory (dynamic obstacle creation)
- **✅ Observer Pattern**: Score/Event observers (loose coupling)

### 🚀 How to Play:
1. **Start Game**: `python3 main.py`
2. **Controls**:
   - `SPACE` or `UP` - Jump over obstacles
   - `DOWN` or `S` - Duck under birds
   - `P` - Pause/Resume
   - `ESC` or `Q` - Quit
3. **Test Components**: `python3 test_game.py`

### 🎉 Game Features:
- **Interactive T-Rex Gameplay**: Real jumping, ducking, and obstacle avoidance
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Speed increases as score goes up
- **Multiple Obstacle Types**: Cacti, birds, and rocks with different behaviors
- **Score System**: Points for distance traveled and obstacles avoided
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### ⚠️ Problem Solved:
The issue was that the enhanced UI system created an infinite menu loop that prevented actual gameplay. By simplifying the main entry point and removing the complex UI package, the game now properly connects the menu to the interactive T-Rex running experience.

**Status**: 🟢 **WORKING** - The game now provides actual interactive T-Rex gameplay when "Start Game" is selected!
