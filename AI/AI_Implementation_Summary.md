# AI Implementation Summary (Current)

This document summarizes automated assistance provided so far in the Python rewrite of the Godot endless runner.

## Key Additions

- Introduced powerup framework and implemented two concrete effects:
	- `halfspeed`: slows gameplay movement to 70% without reducing score gain
	- `doublegold`: doubles coin (token) value during active duration
- Separated `base_speed` (scoring & difficulty) from `speed` (world motion) for fair slowdown handling.
- Extended HUD to render active powerups with remaining seconds.
- Token manager returns `(coin_value, powerup_effects)` enabling simultaneous coin collection and powerup activation.

## Design Decisions

- Timed powerups stored in `active_powerups` dict `{ name: remaining_seconds }` with perâ€‘frame decrement & expiry cleanup.
- Re-collection refreshes duration instead of stacking magnitude for balance simplicity.
- Difficulty linked to cumulative `score` (not current slowed speed) to preserve intended progression pacing.

## Pending / Backlog

- Additional powerup types (invincibility, shield, score multiplier).
- Potential refactor: strategy objects per powerup effect if count grows.
- Performance profiling & possible sprite batching once animation set expands.

## Notes

Planned systems (shop, skins, themed backgrounds) referenced in early design docs are not yet implemented; README now distinguishes current vs planned scope.
